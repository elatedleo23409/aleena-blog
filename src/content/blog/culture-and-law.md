        efface, to offer protection with one hand while scripting erasure with

        - the Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act, 1947, framed
        during colonial rule and retained in post-independence India in the name
        of reform, came to criminalise a community, collapse a multifaceted
        identity, and displace a centuries-old art form from its original
        custodians. This is the story of </span

        potential: to serve as a tool of social reform while simultaneously
        becoming a conduit for cultural obliteration. Enacted under the guise of
        protection, the legislation overlooked the complexities of lived
        experience, collapsing a layered performative identity into a singular
        moral archetype and facilitating the legitimised appropriation of an art
        form through the very language of justice. This narrative illustrates
        the often-overlooked plurality of the implications and ramifications of
        law, how the same law that promises liberation may also instantiate
        exclusion. The Devadasi question thus becomes emblematic of a deeper
        juridical paradox: one that reveals the dissonance between legislative
        intent and lived consequence.

        peripheries of both urban and rural economies. Socially, they have been
        unjustly equated with sex workers or prostitutes, denied dignity, and
        deprived of fundamental rights and representation. Culturally, their art

        entire community&rsquo;s artistic, ritualistic, and cultural legacy by
        conflating all Devadasis with prostitution. This case reveals how laws,

        rehabilitation mechanisms for women displaced as a consequence of the

        India&rsquo;s Intellectual Property Rights regime, specifically, for the
        protection of Traditional Cultural Expressions and the legal recognition
        of custodianship over traditional art forms. As part of this effort, I
        have represented bardic communities during the past year of my legal

        this advocacy. It traces the arc of artistic revivalism during colonial

        Book Fair, 2023. It was also included in the curriculum of the Rajasthan

        rewriting how young minds engage with law, culture and forgotten
        identities.

        injustices we overlook, and the role of law in shaping both,

        Through every page I write, I attempt to preserve what was nearly lost
        and to advocate for a legal imagination that honours India&rsquo;s
        diverse artistic legacy. Additionally, as a lawyer and writer, I have
        been advocating for the recognition of Traditional Cultural Expressions
        within India&rsquo;s IPR regime. My legal work has focused on
        representing bardic and indigenous communities, and my writing seeks to
        restore erased histories. Yet, I face institutional resistance, academic
        gatekeeping, and a lack of funding for legal reform in the cultural
        space.

          career of training under teachers as early as five years of age. She
          is taught to read, dance and sing, and instructed in every seductive
          art. Her songs are usually amorous; and while she is yet a mere girl,
          before she can realise fully the moral bearings of her choice of life,
          she makes her debut as a nautch girl in the community by the
          observation of a shocking custom which is in itself enough to condemn

          >&ldquo;It is necessary before applying this presumption to make sure
          that we have got the conditions necessary for its existence. It is not
          superfluous to suggest that, first of all, there must be somebody of
          neighbours, many or few, or some sort of public, large or small,
          before repute can arise Again, the habit and repute, which alone is
          effective is habit and repute of that particular status which, in the
          country in question, is lawful marriage. The difference between
          English and Oriental customs about the relations of the sexes make
          such caution especially necessary. Among most English people, open
          cohabitation without marriage is so uncommon that the fact of
          cohabitation in many classes of society of itself sets up, as a matter
          of fact, a repute of marriage. But, in countries where customs are
          different, it is necessary to be more discriminating more especially
          owing to the laxity with which the word &lsquo;wife&rsquo; is used by
          witnesses in regard to the connexions not reprobated by opinion, but
          not constituting marriage. [&hellip;] On the evidence on record, there
          can be little doubt that the appellant belongs to the
          &lsquo;Kalavathulla&rsquo; community and was treated prior to her
          becoming the mistress of Ramaswami as a devadasi. Exhibit B-11
          establishes that she was one of the inamdars of the devadasi inam in
          Markapur. D.W. 2, he brother, admitted that their forefathers were
          entitled to devadasi inam in Markapur temple. The evidence on record
          and the surrounding circumstance clearly establish that the appellant
          was not lawfully married to Ramaswami but went to him as his concubine
          and lived with him in that status till his death. For these reasons,
          we uphold the Judgment under appeal and dismiss with costs;&rdquo; </span
