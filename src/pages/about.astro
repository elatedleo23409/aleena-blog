In 2025, she was also nominated as a proposed member of the <strong>Young South Asia Leaders Initiative</strong>. Her research in the field of artistic revivalism also earned her an invitation to the <strong>Kala Sahitya Rachna Shivir</strong> at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, where she participated in an exclusive interaction with the Hon'ble President of India, <strong>Smt.
