	<p>
		I am <strong>Aleena Anabelly A</strong>, a legal practitioner, cultural advocate, and author whose work sits at the intersection of law, culture, and social justice. I hold a <strong>BBA LL.B. (Hons)</strong> degree from the School of Law, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bengaluru, Karnataka, where I ranked first in my batch and was honored with the <strong>H. Venkatesh Reddy Gold Medal for Best Student</strong>.
	</p>

	<h2>Academic Excellence & Recognition</h2>
	<p>
		My academic journey extends beyond the legal sphere into the realms of political philosophy, history, and cultural studies. I am also an alumna of the <strong>University of Oxford's Department of Continuing Education</strong>, holding a Diploma in Political Philosophy. I am the proud recipient of the <strong>Goolam E. Vahanvati Memorial Merit Scholarship</strong> for legal education from 2019 to 2024.
	</p>

	<p>
		My paper, titled <em>'Bridging the Divide,'</em> which critically examines inequalities in India, earned recognition and the opportunity to present before UN officials as part of the <strong>United Nations 75 Dialogue Creation Program</strong>, organized by the Albertian Foundation in collaboration with the United Nations, where I was selected as <strong>'Ambassador for Equality'</strong>.
	</p>

	<h2>Published Author & PM YUVA Scholar</h2>
	<p>
		Driven by a passion for research and writing, I was selected as a <strong>PM YUVA mentorship candidate</strong>, a prestigious program hosted by the Ministry of Education and the National Book Trust (NBT) of India. As part of this program, my book, titled <strong><em>'Samsara: The Revived Glory of Indian Art Forms,'</em></strong> was published by French Nobel Laureate Annie Ernaux during the inaugural ceremony of the World Book Fair in New Delhi.
	</p>

	<p>
		The book earned a place in the National Book Trust's assorted collection showcased at the Seoul International Book Fair and the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair in 2023, and was included in the curriculum of the Rajasthan Higher Education Board, marking a significant step toward rewriting how young minds engage with law, culture, and forgotten identities.
	</p>

	<h2>Cultural Advocacy & Legal Practice</h2>
	<p>
		Raised in <strong>Kannur, Kerala</strong>—a land of ancient art and tradition—I developed a deep connection to performative art forms like Theyyam, Bharatanatyam, and Kathakali. These experiences fueled my desire to protect traditional expressions and champion the rights of indigenous artistic communities.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a lawyer before the <strong>High Court of Kerala</strong>, I have had the honor of representing bardic communities and indigenous groups in intellectual property rights litigation, fighting for recognition of their collective artistic ownership. Through my research, I discovered how the Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act, 1947, led to the marginalization of the Devadasi community and their art, igniting my mission to advocate for cultural justice.
	</p>

	<h2>Presidential Recognition & International Exchange</h2>
	<p>
		My work was recognized when I was invited to the <strong>Kala Sahitya Rachna Shivir</strong> for an exclusive interaction with the Hon'ble President of India, <strong>Smt. Droupadi Murmu</strong>, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi, in February 2024.
	</p>

	<p>
		My selection for the prestigious <strong>Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative (GKSEI)</strong> by the U.S. Department of State significantly enriched my intercultural perspective. This fully-sponsored academic exchange provided me with the opportunity to engage in profound discussions on civil rights, social justice, and inclusion. I am currently leading an Action Research Project for the publication of a children's book that simplifies the life and philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of State.
	</p>

	<h2>Leadership & Community Engagement</h2>
	<p>
		As a member of Christ University's Student Council (2022–2023), I advocated for student welfare while serving as Treasurer of the Debating Society. I also took on leadership roles within the Literary and Debating Society and the Intellectual Property Rights Committee, where I mentored students and drove discussions on literature and law.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a volunteer for <strong>Nalla Padam</strong> with Malayala Manorama (2018-2019), I interviewed Kerala's Education Minister on equal access to education, sparking my commitment to social equity and reinforcing my passion for advocacy, education, and cultural preservation.
	</p>

	<h2>Mission & Vision</h2>
	<p>
		My work focuses on advocating for stronger legal frameworks that protect traditional cultural expressions, knowledge, and folklore from exploitation. Through research, policy work, and writing, I aim to highlight the intersection of law and culture, pushing for reforms that safeguard the rights of indigenous artistic communities.
	</p>

	<p>
		Through every page I write and every case I argue, I attempt to preserve what was nearly lost and to advocate for a legal imagination that honors India's diverse artistic legacy. My activism finds its rhythm in writing, in igniting conversations on the histories we inherit, the injustices we overlook, and the role of law in shaping both—particularly from the vantage point of cultural and artistic revival.
