			<h1>✨ Welcome to Aleena's Blog</h1>
			<p>
				I'm <strong>Aleena Anabelly A</strong>, a legal practitioner, cultural advocate, and author working at the intersection of law, culture, and social justice. This blog serves as a platform to explore the intricate relationships between legal frameworks and cultural preservation, with a particular focus on safeguarding traditional art forms and the rights of indigenous artistic communities.
			</p>

			<h2>About My Work</h2>
			<p>
				As a BBA LL.B. (Hons) graduate from CHRIST University (ranked first in batch) and Oxford alumna, I combine rigorous legal scholarship with passionate cultural advocacy. My book <strong><em>"Samsara: The Revived Glory of Indian Art Forms,"</em></strong> published by the National Book Trust of India under the PM YUVA program, traces how legal systems have historically shaped—and often suppressed—the lives of artists in India.
			</p>

			<h2>Current Focus Areas</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Cultural Justice:</strong> Advocating for legal recognition of traditional cultural expressions and the rights of their custodians</li>
				<li><strong>Intellectual Property Rights:</strong> Protecting traditional knowledge, art forms, and folklore from exploitation</li>
				<li><strong>Legal Reform:</strong> Examining how laws can either suppress or sustain artistic expression</li>
				<li><strong>Historical Documentation:</strong> Writing about art histories that are frequently relegated to footnotes yet foundational to India's cultural heritage</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Recognition & Impact</h2>
			<p>
				My work has been recognized through various honors including the <strong>H. Venkatesh Reddy Gold Medal</strong>, selection as <strong>'Ambassador for Equality'</strong> in the UN75 Global Dialogue Summit, and an invitation to the <strong>Kala Sahitya Rachna Shivir</strong> for an exclusive interaction with Hon'ble President Smt. Droupadi Murmu.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As a recipient of the <strong>Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative</strong> by the U.S. Department of State, I continue to build bridges between cultures while advocating for marginalized communities and their artistic traditions.
			</p>

			<h2>Legal Practice</h2>
			<p>
				As a practicing lawyer before the <strong>High Court of Kerala</strong>, I represent bardic communities and indigenous groups in intellectual property rights litigation, fighting for recognition of their collective artistic ownership. This practical experience reinforces my belief that law, when wielded consciously, can help restore dignity and visibility to historically silenced performative traditions.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Join me</strong> in exploring how we can reshape legal frameworks to honor our diverse cultural heritage, preserve what was nearly lost, and advocate for a legal imagination that protects the rhythms that reside at the heart of our shared humanity.

				"From my experience, my activism finds its rhythm in writing, in igniting conversations on the histories we inherit, the injustices we overlook, and the role of law in shaping both—particularly from the vantage point of cultural and artistic revival."
