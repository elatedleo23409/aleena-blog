        efface, to offer protection with one hand while scripting erasure with
        the other. This Case Study shall traces one such paradox: how a statute
        - the Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act, 1947, framed
        during colonial rule and retained in post-independence India in the name
        of reform, came to criminalise a community, collapse a multifaceted
        identity, and displace a centuries-old art form from its original
        custodians. This is the story of </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Sadir, </span><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>the dance of the Devadasis (erstwhile form of </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Bharatanatyam</span><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>), and the </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasis, </span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>a quasi-matrilineal community of South India. </span> </p> <p class="c20 c27" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz></span></p> <p class="c27" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz> <span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Sadir</span><sup class="c9 c32" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>[1]</a></sup><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>, represents a felicitous union between the divine and the
        ever-auspicious brides of the divine &ndash; a celestial embrace of the
        mortal and the spiritual. It is a liberating portrayal of pure
        affection, wherein, the </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasis </span><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>expressed their unwavering devotion for Hindu Gods through agile
        footwork, graceful hand gestures, and radiant expressions. This
        depiction of devotion often bore undertones of eroticism. With the arrow
        of time, </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Sadir</span><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;and the identity of </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasis</span><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;have undergone a significant evolution, with their trajectory
        being shaped by law, both customary and statutory. Among such laws, the
        Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act, 1947 stands out as
        particularly consequential. By collapsing the rich and multifaceted
        identity of the </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasis</span><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;of Madras into a reductive narrative of prostitution, the Act
        erased their artistic and cultural agency. In contemporary India, </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasis</span><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;&ndash; once revered custodians of a sacred art form, are now
        often equated with sex workers, stripped of representation and social
        dignity. The cultural history of the </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasi</span><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;tradition, alongside the legal trajectory of the 1947 Act,
        reveals that law, depending on its intent and application, can either
        suppress or sustain artistic expression. It is therefore imminent to
        reimagine legal reforms as frameworks that safeguard artistic heritage
        and the rights of its practitioners, especially in contexts as
        historically layered and socially fraught as that of the </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasis</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>. Aligning with this goal, through this case study, I seek to
        articulate the essence of my life&rsquo;s work - mapping the legal and
        historic contours of art and its expression, shaping policy and
        jurisprudence to safeguard and collectivise artistic communities, and
        preserving the cultural rhythms that reside at the heart of our shared

The rise of </span><span class="c5" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Vijayanagara</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;empire in the Deccan during the 1300s formalised the customary
        practise of temple dedication, through which young girls and women were

        since the 18</span><span class="c1" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>th</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;century, under the Maratha dominion and colonial rule,

Likely, in the English imagination, </span><span class="c5" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Sadir</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;was misrepresented as a &lsquo;seductive art&rsquo; performed by

        emergence of the anti-nautch movement in colonial India. The anti-nautch
        movement, which opposed the Devadasis system and </span><span class="c5" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Pottukattuthal</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>, culminated in the enactment of Madras Devadasi (Prevention of
        Dedication) Act, 1947. This legislation unjustly established a legal
        presumption that the six specified </span><span class="c5" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasi</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;communities, enlisted under Section 3 of the Act, engaged in
        dance or music performances inherently bear the identity of a
        prostitute. Additionally, Section 4(2) criminalizes the performance of
        the </span><span class="c5" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasis</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&rsquo; dance by prescribing punitive sanctions. Notably, the exclusive
        scope of the Act of 1947 singularly targeted the custodians of </span><span class="c5" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Sadir</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;&ndash; </span><span class="c5" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasis</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;and similar communities &ndash; while omitting others. This

        occupied by </span><span class="c5" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasi</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;women by dominant castes. Likely, during a period when the

        shaped by law. This trajectory of evolution of the </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasi</span><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;identity and </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Sadir </span><span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>underscores the enduring impact of laws on cultural identity. The </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act, 1947</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>, as this case study demonstrates, exemplifies the law&rsquo;s dual
        potential: to serve as a tool of social reform while simultaneously
        becoming a conduit for cultural obliteration. Enacted under the guise of
        protection, the legislation overlooked the complexities of lived
        experience, collapsing a layered performative identity into a singular
        moral archetype and facilitating the legitimised appropriation of an art
        form through the very language of justice. This narrative illustrates
        the often-overlooked plurality of the implications and ramifications of
        law, how the same law that promises liberation may also instantiate
        exclusion. The Devadasi question thus becomes emblematic of a deeper
        juridical paradox: one that reveals the dissonance between legislative
        intent and lived consequence.

        Madras Presidency (modern Tamil Nadu), Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and
        Maharashtra. These regions once preserved thriving </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Devadasi</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;traditions, particularly in temples of Chidambaram, Tanjore, and
        Madurai. Under colonial governance and subsequent State legislations in
        post-colonial India, the socio-political climate shifted towards
        homogenised morality and Brahmanical cultural ideals, enabling
        upper-caste and elite appropriation of temple arts. Economically, the
        cessation of temple grants and royal patronage displaced many Devadasi
        families from their traditional livelihoods, forcing them to the
        peripheries of both urban and rural economies. Socially, they have been
        unjustly equated with sex workers or prostitutes, denied dignity, and
        deprived of fundamental rights and representation. Culturally, their art
        is now performed, commercialised, and celebrated by individuals who
        often fail to acknowledge the Devadasis&rsquo; foundational role in
        shaping and preserving the tradition.</span> </p> <p class="c27 c20" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz></span></p> <p class="c27" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz> <span class="c9" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>While such discrimination continues to persist, it would be inaccurate
        to assert that the enactment of the 1947 Act was entirely unjustified or
        devoid of merit. </span><span class="c9 c17" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Pottukattuthal</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>, the ceremonial dedication of girls as Devadasis, undoubtedly called
        for reform, as by the 18th century, it had become entangled with the
        sexual economy surrounding temples. In seeking to abolish this practice,
        colonial administrators, missionaries, and Indian reformers believed
        they were dismantling exploitation. Yet, the Madras Devadasi (Prevention
        of Dedication) Act, 1947, while ending temple dedications, erased an
        entire community&rsquo;s artistic, ritualistic, and cultural legacy by
        conflating all Devadasis with prostitution. This case reveals how laws,
        if imprecisely crafted, can perpetuate the very harm they aim to
        eliminate. If the State, in reforming, ends up silencing, does it not
        bear the responsibility to restore what it erased? And to what extent
        should the State have the authority to regulate cultural memory and

        the Act of 1947, the Government of India and respective State
        authorities have consistently failed to implement adequate
        rehabilitation mechanisms for women displaced as a consequence of the
        Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act, 1947. Simultaneously,
        the judiciary has demonstrated a limited interpretative vision,
        persistently viewing Devadasis through the legally imposed identity of
        &lsquo;prostitutes&rsquo; rather than acknowledging their complex
        socio-cultural roles as artists, ritualists, and knowledge bearers. This
        failure has contributed to their political invisibility, cultural
        marginalisation, and economic exclusion. Although various policy think

        conflated with prostitution. The absence of this historical

        Devadasis be equally recognised and taught as part of the dance

        form&rsquo;s emergent history should be formally integrated into the

        can protect the intangible: the stories, songs, and movements that live
        within traditional performative art forms. Much of my work has revolved
        around studying how legal systems, both colonial and post-colonial, have
        contributed to the erasure of cultural identities and the
        marginalization of artists. My writing has become my voice in this
        movement. </span><span class="c5" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Samsara: The Revived Glory of Indian Art Forms</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>, my first book, published by the National Book Trust of India under
        the Prime Minister&rsquo;s YUVA Mentorship Program, is the wellspring of
        this advocacy. It traces the arc of artistic revivalism during colonial
        rule and reflects on how law has historically shaped, and often
        suppressed, the lives of artists in India. A section of the book traces
        the emergent history of </span><span class="c5" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>Bharatanatyam</span><span class="c0" data-astro-cid-eh3ny5mz>&nbsp;by recharacterizing the Devadasis as its original custodians,
        marking my first attempt at writing history through the act of
        redirecting credit to those people and places that have been forgotten
        or seldom acknowledged in contemporary discourse. The book&rsquo;s
        reception reaffirmed my belief in the power of storytelling to drive
        reform. It was featured in the National Book Trust&rsquo;s collection at
        the Seoul International Book Fair, 2023, and the Abu Dhabi International
        Book Fair, 2023. It was also included in the curriculum of the Rajasthan
        Higher Education Board, marking a small but significant step toward
        rewriting how young minds engage with law, culture and forgotten
        identities.

        particularly from the vantage point of cultural and artistic revival.
        Through every page I write, I attempt to preserve what was nearly lost
        and to advocate for a legal imagination that honours India&rsquo;s
        diverse artistic legacy. Additionally, as a lawyer and writer, I have
        been advocating for the recognition of Traditional Cultural Expressions
        within India&rsquo;s IPR regime. My legal work has focused on
        representing bardic and indigenous communities, and my writing seeks to
        restore erased histories. Yet, I face institutional resistance, academic
        gatekeeping, and a lack of funding for legal reform in the cultural

          that we have got the conditions necessary for its existence. It is not

          neighbours, many or few, or some sort of public, large or small,
          before repute can arise Again, the habit and repute, which alone is
          effective is habit and repute of that particular status which, in the
          country in question, is lawful marriage. The difference between
          English and Oriental customs about the relations of the sexes make
          such caution especially necessary. Among most English people, open
          cohabitation without marriage is so uncommon that the fact of
          cohabitation in many classes of society of itself sets up, as a matter
          of fact, a repute of marriage. But, in countries where customs are
          different, it is necessary to be more discriminating more especially
          owing to the laxity with which the word &lsquo;wife&rsquo; is used by
          witnesses in regard to the connexions not reprobated by opinion, but
          not constituting marriage. [&hellip;] On the evidence on record, there
          can be little doubt that the appellant belongs to the
          &lsquo;Kalavathulla&rsquo; community and was treated prior to her
          becoming the mistress of Ramaswami as a devadasi. Exhibit B-11
          establishes that she was one of the inamdars of the devadasi inam in
          Markapur. D.W. 2, he brother, admitted that their forefathers were
          entitled to devadasi inam in Markapur temple. The evidence on record
          and the surrounding circumstance clearly establish that the appellant
          was not lawfully married to Ramaswami but went to him as his concubine
          and lived with him in that status till his death. For these reasons,
